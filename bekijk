Wu-Manber algorithm op DFA

Robertson and Seymour about
graph minors that says that if X is any property of graphs that is closed
under taking minors, then there exists a polynomial time algorithm for
testing the property X.  

"Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. 
 Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, 
 by definition, not smart enough to debug it."
